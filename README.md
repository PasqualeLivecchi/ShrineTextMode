# ShrineTextMode
Shrine running in text mode instead of graphics mode with no boot menu.

Now you can code in HolyC anywhere you have a Linux terminal including through ConnectBot on your android phone if you so desire!  Since it is text mode in a terminal you can easily copy/paste content between your TempleOS/Shrine VM and your Linux machine.

Run qemu with the -curses option.
